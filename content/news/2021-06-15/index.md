[Kless](https://www.artstation.com/kless) and I are currently working on a new assets pack, it's going to be a pack of models of an urban city.

Right now it's too early to tell how big it's going to be but we can say that it could be released around the end of July.

Building these assets is necessary for the future short film we are working on.

For the models, we are trying to make the shaders as procedural as possible, for example for the traffic cones we made use of a procedural hexagons texture.

After the models are done, we are going to polish them and add dirt and other imperfections, then we are going to work on the trailer.
