    <p>Hello, I'm Marco and I'm keeping this website alive.
    <br>First of all thank you everyone for supporting us by buying our products, we really hope they help you make better art.
    <br>So, I thought it would be a better way to communicate with you through this sort of blog post place where we share the advancements of our projects as we go.
    <br>Also it serves as a way to better explain the decisions we take.
    <br>To start off let me explain who we are and what we do:
    <br>I'm Marco Pavanello and I am 23 years old, currently I live in Italy (north) and have been using Blender since 2011, but started selling products about 4 years ago.
    <br>Wolf is just a name as of today, but I'm willing to make it a recognized company in the future. What I've been doing over these years is basically assets and add-ons with both artists and developers (Stefan Radenkovic, Nathan Craddock, Joseph Dowling and others...).
    <br>My mission is to use Blender and other free and open source software to create assets, tools and ultimately movies.
    <br>There are going to be many other posts after this one so further information will come.</p>
