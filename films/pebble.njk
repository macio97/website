	<h2>Story</h2>
	<p>Pebble is a caterpillar made of pebbles that lives on the ground of a forest among other normal caterpillars, his dream is to reach a green leaf like the other caterpillars do.
He sees other caterpillars eating the green leaves on the upper trees so he wants too.
He tries to climb a plant but because he is heavy, he falls down when he reaches the leaf.
He tries again to climb that plant but this time a bird takes him off.
Then he tries to climb the tree, but while he is climbing a storm was coming and a lightning hit the trunk making him thrown away.
The tree falls down and Pebble finally sees in front of him all the leaves of the tree.
